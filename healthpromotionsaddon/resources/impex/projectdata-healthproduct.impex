;prod_1011;1 MHz Portable Therapeutic Ultrasound Unit Complete Kit ;healthequipment;"<p>Get muscle pain relief using Ultrasound Therapy.

This brand new 2014 edition Portable Ultrasound generates deep heat within body tissues for the treatment at selected medical conditions such as relief at pain, muscle spasms, and joint contractures.

The Portable Ultrasound is a therapeutic ultrasound device that generates deep heat through a piezoelectric crystal sound head. Unlike electrical modalities, ultrasound is unique in that the longitudinal waveform associated with sound is not electromagnetic in nature. The piezoelectric crystal converts electrical energy into a strong vibratory sound wave or ultrasound, a sound beyond the normal range of our hearing.

Sound waves cause vibration in soft tissue cells, increasing temperature and inducing vasodilation

Treatment duration is determined by the medical practitioner and may range from 5 - 10 minutes depending on the conditions treated.

Because air is a very poor sound conductor ultrasound gels are used to conduct the wave energy to the skin.
